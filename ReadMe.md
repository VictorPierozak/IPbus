# IPbus interface

## General notes

- The implementation provides synchronized message exchange and periodic asynchronous message exchange. If you need periodic uploads, you can set the cycle time (in seconds) and run the timer. WARNING: For now, the timer cannot be stopped.
- Pthread library is required
- boost::asio is required
- It is adviced to use IPbusTarget class as a base class for specific usage

## IPbus specification

IPbus is a packet-based protocol. An IPbus packet stacks multiple transactions, with the maximum packet size set to 1500 bytes, though it can be adjusted (const uint16_t maxPacket within IPbusControlPacket.h). Full IPbus documentation is provided  [here](https://ipbus.web.cern.ch/doc/user/html/_downloads/d251e03ea4badd71f62cffb24f110cfa/ipbus_protocol_v2_0.pdf).

## Building

### Requirements
- C++20
- boost::asio
- pthread

### Step-by-step

If you already pulled repository, then you need to:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake3 ..
cmake3 --build .
```

## Documentation

### Example
You can find an examples within the test directory. Content of the example.cpp file is included below.
```
#include <iostream>
#include<chrono>
#include<thread>
#include<ctime>
#include "IPbusInterface.h"

#define SIZE 2

int main() {
    try {
        srand(time(NULL));

        boost::asio::io_context io;
        IPbusTarget target(io,"172.20.75.175", 0, 50001);
        IPbusControlPacket packet;

        uint32_t data[SIZE] = {0x0,0x0};
        uint32_t address = 0x1004;

        packet.addTransaction(TransactionType::ipread, address, data, SIZE);
        target.transcieve(packet);

        std::cout << "\nRead...\n";
        std::cout << std::hex << data[0] << ' ' << std::hex << data[1] << std::endl;

    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    };
    return 0;
}
```
In general, sending IPbus packet follows below schema.
1. Create a boost::asio::io_context variable (it must exist for the entire program's lifetime).
2. Create IPbusTarget object, you need to provide io_context, remote device address, and port it listens to
3. Create IPbusControlPacket object
4. Create a buffer for data
5. Add transaction to the packet: you need to provide transaction type, register address, buffer address and number of words
6. Pass packet to IPbusTarget::transcieve (called on the created IPbusTarget object)

## How to create a packet

`IPbusControlPacket` class is responsible for preparing IPbus packet to be sent. You can add transaction to packet using `addTransaction` method with following arguments:

- `TransactionType` type- transaction type (`IPbusHeaders.h`)
- `uint32_t` address - register address (or address of first register for multi-register write)
- `uint32_t` data - pointer to buffer with data
- `uint8_t` words - number of (32 bits) words

`IPbusControlPacket` provides also `addWordToWrite` for one-word write and `addNBitsToChange` for RMWbits operation.

After adding all transaction you can pass the packet to the `IPbusTarget`
